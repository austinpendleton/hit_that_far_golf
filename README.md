## About
This app is my first solo app testing my skills in both front and back end development.
I Can Hit That Far is an app centered around one of my favortie hobbies - golf. While using this app, the user first adds clubs to their bag including the club name and what yardage they are comfortable hitting that club. After adding all the clubs to their bag, while out golfing - the user inputs current yardage to the flag and the app will respond with the club the user should use based on their previous inputs.
